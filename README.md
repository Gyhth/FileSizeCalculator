FileSizeCalculator
==================

A Javascript function that takes an integer representing a number of bytes, and calculates the file size of that integer.

It is written in Javascript, but in theory the function can be taken across to any lanauges they are required in. The main points that would need to be changed are simply the way the variables are called - var <variable> vs $<variable> vs Integer <variable>, etc - and the Math.pow() would need to be changed to your languages function to raise a number to a power.
